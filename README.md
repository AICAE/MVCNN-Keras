# HI

this is the MVCNN model coding with keras.  
Inspired by WeiTang114's project MVCNN-TensorFlow.

# Requirements
* CUDA 9.0 (if you have NVIDIA GPU)
* python 2.7 or python 3.5+
* tensorflow 1.12.0
* tensorflow-gpu 1.12.0 (if you have NVIDIA GPU)
* nvidia-ml-py(for python 2.7)
* nvidia-ml-py3(for python 3.5+)
* some other python packages

# Note
there still have some overfitting problem
